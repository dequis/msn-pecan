# Mailing list #

The best place to get answers is to send an email to our mailing list: [msn-pecan@googlegroups.com](mailto:msn-pecan@googlegroups.com).

However, if you are not subscribed it might take time for moderation, therefore it's better if you subscribe in [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/msn-pecan), also you would be able to join the discussion this way.

You can also use Google Groups as a forum kind of thing.

# IRC #

You can join #msn-pecan on irc.freenode.net, currently people join around UTC+8.

# Twitter #

Yes, that's right, you can also join the discussion on [twitter](http://twitter.com), just put "#msn-pecan" in your message so that we can find it.

To see these messages you can go to [twitag](http://www.twitag.com/tag/msn-pecan). (I've just started to use this thing)

# Directly #

You can just add me directly **felipe.contreras** at Google Talk.
