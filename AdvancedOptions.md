# Details #

  * **Use HTTP Method:** Connect to MSN servers using outgoing port 80. Mostly used for firewall and/or proxies. **Note:** the code is not completely stable, so you might experience some issues.

  * **Show custom smileys:** Show the non-standard custom smileys that are sent from other buddies.

  * **Use server-side alias:** If you have an alias set for one of your buddies on the MSN server, use that instead of their set display/nick name. **Note:** don't use this if you use old clients (MSN 7.5) for the same account.

  * **Use direct connections:** For file transfers, use direct connections to the user you are transferring files with. This gives much faster download rates. **Note:** Still experimental.

  * **Use user displays:** Fetch user displays (buddy icons). If you experience crashes, try disabling this option.

  * **Don't show Messenger Plus! tags:** Hide Messenger Plus! tags from nicknames and personal messages.
